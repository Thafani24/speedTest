Keep on shining make it brighter than a spotlight
Even all the scars from your mistakes make up your constellation 
Even if you are not perfect, you are a limited edition
In a world where you feel cold,You gotta stay gold
Didnâ€™t wanna be a princess, I am priceless
You pity me, but I pity you more for pitying me
